# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

Tags: Array/Two Pointers

Difficulty: Easy

## Description

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array *nums* = `[1,1,2]`,

Your function should return length = `2`, with the first two elements of *nums* being `1` and `2` respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

## Solutions

### 1. use two pointers

Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers i and j, where i is the slow-runner while j is the fast-runner. As long as $nums[i] = nums[j]$, we increment j to skip the duplicate. When we encounter $nums[j] \neq nums[i]$, the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to nums[i + 1]. i is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until j reaches the end of array.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[j]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i+1;
    }
};
```

### 2. similar solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i-1])
                count++;
            else
                nums[i-count] = nums[i];
        }
        return nums.size()-count;
    }
};
```

# 119. Pascal's Triangle II

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/description/)

Tags: Array

Difficulty: Easy

## Description

Given an index *k*, return the *k*th row of the Pascal's triangle.

For example, given *k* = 3,
Return `[1,3,3,1]`.

**Note:**
Could you optimize your algorithm to use only *O*(*k*) extra space?



## Solutions

### my solution

Notice that the number of elements grows as index of rows grow. In order to use only O(k) extra space, we can update from back to front.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        vector<int> res(rowIndex+1);
        res[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < rowIndex+1; i++) {
            res[i] = 1;
            for (int j = i-1; j > 0; j--)
                res[j] = res[j] + res[j-1];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
